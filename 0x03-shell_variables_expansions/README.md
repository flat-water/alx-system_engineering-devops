This ReadMe, written Tuesday, June 13, 2023 15:44 CST sums ups the challenges for the day, still on the gracious ALX S.E. course, on the project at hand: Shell, init files, variables and expansions
To be fair, I doubt the title of the project sums up what the tasks are going to be about. I mean, first task is about ALIASES, bro!
Well...
We make use of the ff:
-Variables
-Aliases
-Expansions
-Write more Bash scripts ofc!
And some common commands were
**
printenv
set
unset
export
alias
unalias
.
source
printf etc
